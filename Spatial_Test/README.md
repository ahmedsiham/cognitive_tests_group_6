Spatial Reasoning Test


Welcome to the Spatial Reasoning Test!Before proceeding, please take a moment to read the important information below.


DATA CONSENT INFORMATION:
We may record your response data for educational teaching purposes and practicing data analysis and visualization. The data collected will be anonymized and stored in a public data repository.
If you consent to the upload, please type "yes" in the box provided. If you choose not to provide consent, your test results will not be uploaded.


TEST PURPOSE:
This programme aims to assess a person spatial reasoning, asking them a series of 8 questions in which a projection of a shape is shown as well as 
3 images of the same shape in different angles and an image which is not the original shape but aims to imitate it. The user is then asked to select which one is
not the original shape by using the buttons displayed. The programme asks for the users sex and uploads it in google forms (if the user grants permission), it can then go on to be transferred 
to a csv format in google sheets where further analysis can take place.


HOW THE TEST OPERATES:
The test primariy runs through two lists, one containing the numbers 1 to 8 in string fomrat, and several planes of view (e.g xy, yz) and the incorrect image. The first list is iterated through using a for loop, in which, the code concatenates the current iteration number with '.png' to create the source image. This itereation number is concatenated, using a nested for loop, with the items in the list containing the planes of view and the incorrect image using a nested for loop and '.png'. finally, these are all displayed with a corresponding letter a,b,c or d along side the source image and a panel of buttons. The user is then asked to select the button that corresponds with the incorrect image.
